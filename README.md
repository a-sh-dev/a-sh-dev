#### Current exploration:

- 💡&nbsp; Undertaking Harvard's [*"CS50: Introduction to Computer Science"*](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) to deepen understanding of computer science's intellectual enterprises and the art of programming. I'm curious about how computer science works to ground my practical programming.
- 🔭&nbsp; Exploring `TypeScript` & `GraphQL`.
- 👀&nbsp; Keen on learning `Python`.
- 🌱&nbsp; New projects in the planning:
  - *"To-Do List"*, a simple web app to practice `TypeScript` with `React.js`.
  - *"Job Seeking Tracker"* web app using the `MERN` stack.
  - Instagram clone.


#### Reminder of the day:
> *Even simple questions are powerful. Asking "Why?" provokes reflection. Asking "Why not?" drives innovation.*
