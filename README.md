## 🪴 Hello〜&nbsp;&nbsp; <s>Is it</s> *It is me* you're looking for... &nbsp;🎵

☁️&nbsp;  **I'm Angie, a career changer with 10+ years of experience in the Graphic Design industry. Recently graduated from Coder Academy Fullstack Bootcamp in 2022. I absolutely fell in love with programming and aspire to pursue this career moving ahead.**

🤩&nbsp; I'm very grateful to be part of the [*Seer*](https://seermedical.com) family and start my professional programming journey as an Associate Software Engineer. I hope to continue learning beyond web development and contribute to making a positive impact in the tech world.

#### What I've been up to:

- 💡&nbsp; Undertaking Harvard's [*"CS50: Introduction to Computer Science"*](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) to deepen understanding of computer science's intellectual enterprises and the art of programming. I'm curious about how computer science works to ground my practical programming.
- 🌥&nbsp; Undertaking `AWS` Developer certification through group training.
- 🔭&nbsp; Exploring `TypeScript`, `React-TypeScript`, `GraphQL` & unit testings with `React-Testing-Library`.
- 👀&nbsp; Keen on learning `Python`.
- 🌱&nbsp; New projects in the planning:
  - *"To-Do List"*, a simple web app to practice `TypeScript` with `React.js`.
  - *"Job Seeking Tracker"* web app using the `MERN` stack.
  - Instagram clone (with `TypeScript` and `TDD` 🤞🏼).


#### Reminder of the day:
